## üìù Bash Quoting: "", '', ``, ||, &&, ::

Quoting is used to control how strings and variables are interpreted in bash.

### Double quotes `"..."`

- Variables are expanded
- Command substitution works

```bash
name="Ilkin"
echo "Hello $name"    # Output: Hello Ilkin
```

### Single quotes `'...'`

- Everything is taken literally
- No variable or command substitution

```bash
echo 'Hello $name'    # Output: Hello $name
```

### Backticks `` `...` `` (Command substitution)

```bash
echo "Today is `date`"
```

üü° **Note**: Prefer `$(...)` syntax over backticks:
```bash
echo "Today is $(date)"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operators

### `&&` ‚Äì AND operator
Runs second command only if the first succeeds.

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
```

### `||` ‚Äì OR operator
Runs second command only if the first fails.

```bash
mkdir test || echo "Failed"
```

### `::` ‚Äì Not a standard Bash operator
In bash, `::` has no special meaning. Often used in programming languages like C++ or documentation formatting.
